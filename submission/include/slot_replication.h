/// This module implements a memeory-efficient mechanism to replicate slots
/// across ciphertexts, using the recursive method from https://ia.cr/2014/106
/// section 4.2, but traversing the recursion tree using depth-first search
/// so as to save on memory when the replicas are needed one at a time.
///
/// The simplest use-case is taking a packed ciphertext as input, outputting
/// a vector of ciphertexts with all the slots of the i'th output equal to
/// the i'th slot of the input. More generally, the input ciphertext may
/// already be partially replicated, with the same length-x pattern
/// repeated number of tie to fill all the slots. In that case the output
/// will be a vector of x ciphertexts, with all the slots of the i'th
/// output equal to the i'th slot in the input.
///
/// This implementation is geared towards sequential use of the output
/// ciphertexts, after construction it provides a next_replica() method that
/// returns the next output ciphertext. It is optimized to use the "hoisting"
/// method from https://ia.cr/2018/244 in nodes of the tree with degree>2.
